README file for AndroidApp
	This application is a converter that converts miles to kilometers, celsius to fahrenheit 
	and pounds to kilograms and vice-versa. This is a simple application that is created for cell phones 
	that use android operating system.

The files contained here:

AndroidManifest.xml
	This XML file describes to the Android platform what the application can do. It is a required 
	file, and is the mechanism we use to show your application to the user (in the app launcher's list), 
	handle data types, etc.

src/*
	Under this directory is the Java source for for the application.

src/edu/gatech/unitconverter/MainActivity.java
	The MainActivity class access the other three classes i.e. DistanceActivity.java, TemperatureActivity.java 
	and WeightActivity.java. This class calls the other classes and they implement the main features of the application.

res/layout/activity_main.xml
	The res/layout/ directory contains XML files describing user interface view hierarchies.
	The activity_main.xml file here is used by MainActivity.java to construct its UI.  The base name of 
	each file (all text before a '.' character) is taken as the resource name; it must be lower-case. There are 
	other XML files that describe additional resources included in the application. They all use the same 
	syntax; all of these resources could be defined in one file, but we generally split them apart to 
	keep things organized.
